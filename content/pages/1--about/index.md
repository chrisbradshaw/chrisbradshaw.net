### Bio

Hi, I'm Chris Bradshaw, a web developer from NYC.

**_Non-technical background:_** Out of college I worked for Macy's Inc, where I was promoted 6 times in 5 years eventually managing a flagship store of 600+ employees and over $100M/yr sales volume. Identifying a trend towards ecommerce and away from Brick and Mortar, I left Macy's to start my own wholesale liquidation business called Liquid8 Express, which did $144k revenue in the first 11 months before being sold to a larger competitor.

**_Technical_**: after spending a lot of money paying people to build websites for my business, I decided to learn how to build them myself. I started taking classes online, applied and was accepted to the Flatiron School, a web immersive bootcamp with at that time, a <7% acceptance rate on 11 Broadway in New York City's financial district (right outside the Charging Bull statue).

Out of Flatiron School, I was hired by SpinMedia Group as an AdTech Engineer building out Javascript advertising units on sites like [Spin](https://www.spin.com), [Vibe](https://www.vibe.com), and [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com) reaching over 22M unique visitors per month.

SpinMedia Group was acquired by Billboard Music Group in 2017, and I left to pursue Front End Development work not involving advertisements. I was hired as a freelancer by a Venture Capital firm in Miami, FL to build a single page application, "AirBnB for Marina Slips". I built this project using a Ruby on Rails API on the backend and React.js on the front end. I found further freelance work building an ecommerce site for an emerging CBD brand carried in over 85 stores.

In August 2018, I started working in my current role at Group Nine Media in Soho, New York City on the Consumer Experience team working on all aspects of G9's owned and operated sites [Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com), [POPSUGAR](https://www.popsugar.com), [The Dodo](https://www.thedodo.com), [NowThis News](https://www.nowthisnews.com), [NowThis Originals](https://www.nowthisoriginals.com) and [Seeker](https://www.seeker.com).
